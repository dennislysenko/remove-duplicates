remove-duplicates
=================

Ruby script that recursively deletes duplicate files in a directory

Useful for when you accidentally hit "Consolidate files" on your entire iTunes library.

THIS IS A POTENTIALLY DESTRUCTIVE SCRIPT -- keep $MAX_FILES_TO_DELETE low (10) at first to get a feel for the exact files it's deleting -- MAKE SURE THEY ARE THE RIGHT ONES.
